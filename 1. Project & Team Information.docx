                                                                            Heart Disease Analysis


Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and its impact continues to grow due to lifestyle changes, poor dietary habits, and lack of physical activity. Despite advances in medicine, prevention and early detection remain critical in reducing the risk of severe outcomes. However, analyzing large-scale health data related to heart disease—such as patient demographics, medical history, lifestyle choices, and clinical indicators—requires advanced tools for extracting insights.

In this project, we aim to use Tableau as a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool to analyze heart disease data. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful dashboards, highlight key risk factors, and identify correlations that can support better decision-making for healthcare providers, policymakers, and individuals. By leveraging Tableau’s interactive visualizations, the project seeks to uncover hidden trends, compare patient groups, and tell stories through data that aid in preventive care and awareness.

Scenario 1
Dr. Sharma is a senior cardiologist working at a metropolitan hospital. She wants to understand which lifestyle factors contribute most to the increase in heart disease cases among middle-aged patients. Using Tableau dashboards, she can analyze patient data segmented by age, gender, BMI, cholesterol levels, and smoking habits. This helps her identify high-risk groups and design targeted awareness campaigns, such as advising patients on weight management and smoking cessation programs.

Scenario 2
Ramesh works with a government health department and is tasked with developing preventive health policies. He uses Tableau dashboards to study trends in heart disease prevalence across different regions, comparing rural and urban populations. By analyzing correlations between sedentary lifestyle indicators and disease rates, he can recommend policies such as fitness programs in workplaces, stricter tobacco regulations, and subsidies for healthier food options. Tableau helps him present these findings in interactive dashboards for decision-makers.

Scenario 3
Anita, a 45-year-old professional with a family history of heart disease, wants to monitor her health risks. With simplified Tableau dashboards provided by her healthcare provider, she can visualize her risk factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits compared to healthy benchmarks. The dashboard highlights actionable steps like increasing physical activity or reducing fat intake. This empowers Anita to make informed decisions about her lifestyle and proactively reduce her risk of developing heart disease.
